HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web v369 (based on v368; one-change)

Change made (scoped)
- Home right-rail Trending counties + Counties you follow:
  - County name links no longer truncate with ellipsis; they can wrap to show full name.
  - Tightened spacing for the 7d / 30d / 1y / Overage numeric columns (reduced gaps + widths).

Guardrails respected (no-touch)
- Did NOT modify ticket card static map generation, centering logic, or custom pin sizing.
- Did NOT modify minimap logic.
- Did NOT modify trending/follow label resolver (still uses full names).

Files changed
- templates/home_feed.html
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v361-370.txt

Local smoke test
- python -m py_compile app.py
- es-up
- Verify:
  - Home feed loads; ticket card static images still render
  - Right-rail minimap renders
  - Tables show full county names and tighter numeric columns
