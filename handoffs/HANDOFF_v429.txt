HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v429)

Purpose of v429
- Hotfix regression: Statistics page (/statistics → /strictness) was 500’ing after v428.
- Root cause: strictness_rows() helper was accidentally inlined into profile() (dead code after return), so /strictness called an undefined function.
- Fix: restore strictness_rows() as a proper helper inside create_app() and remove the accidental inlined block.

Current live target
- /healthz is the source of truth for what’s live (ok v### pid=...).
- Going live = git add/commit/push (Render deploys from GitHub).

What to verify
- Open https://enforcedspeed.com/strictness (or /statistics) → should render County Statistics (no Internal Server Error).
- Filters still work (state/county/date/photo/pin) and Clear uses ?clear=1.
- /api/strictness returns JSON (no 500).

Guardrails (NO REGRESSIONS)
- Ticket card static maps must continue to render on Home feed.
- Static ticket map centering stays: county-centered unless explicitly pin-centered.
- Custom pin sizing stays.
- Right-rail layout stays flush/sharp.
- Trending/Follow tables keep county/state names (never raw GEOIDs).
- No expensive geometry unions at request time.
- One theme per ZIP.
