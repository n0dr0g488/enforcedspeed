HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v401)

Goal of v401 (single scoped change)
Fix Map page centering so the header search bar and the map column are centered together (match Home page behavior).

What was wrong
- Map page temporarily switched to an in-flow 3-column flex layout.
- That caused the map column to be centered BETWEEN the two rails instead of being viewport-centered.
- Result: header search (viewport-centered to the 720px column) no longer lined up with the map.

What changed
- templates/map_page.html
  - Removed the in-flow 3-column flex layout overrides.
  - Map page now uses the same "overlay rails" model as Home:
    - Left/right rails stay fixed to the viewport edges (global CSS).
    - Center map column remains truly viewport-centered (720px column), aligning with the header search.
    - Center column is still viewport-locked (no page scroll) and keeps the symmetric top/bottom buffer around the map card.

Files changed
- templates/map_page.html
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v401-410.txt
- handoffs/HANDOFF_v401.txt

Non‑negotiable guardrails (do not regress)
- Home feed ticket card static maps must render.
- Static ticket map centering logic stays: county-centered unless explicitly pin-centered.
- Custom pin sizing stays (no massive pins).
- Right-rail layout stays: flush/sharp panel style.
- Trending/Follow tables keep county/state names (never GEOIDs).
- No runtime geometry unions per request.

Smoke tests (required)
1) python -m py_compile app.py
2) Run es-up
3) Verify:
   - Home: ticket card static maps render.
   - Map: header search bar visually lines up with the centered map column (same as Home).
   - Map: rails remain flush to edges and full-height.
   - Map: bottom buffer around map card still visible.
