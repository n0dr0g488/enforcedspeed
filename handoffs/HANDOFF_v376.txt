HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web v376 (based on v375; one-change)

Goal / bug
- Ticket-card + minimap Static Maps were falling back to default Google pins and sometimes g.co/staticmaperror.
- Debug showed icon fetch timeouts when the icon URL lived under the main app domain (Cloudflare/bot/WAF variability).

Change made (scoped)
- Added support for a dedicated public static icon host via STATIC_PIN_BASE_URL.
  - Example value: https://static.enforcedspeed.com/pins
  - County static map + /api/staticmap now build marker icon URLs from STATIC_PIN_BASE_URL when set.
  - Fallback remains the app-served /static/img/pins path.

What you must set in Render env (Web + Worker via Env Group)
- STATIC_PIN_BASE_URL = https://static.enforcedspeed.com/pins

Guardrails respected
- Did NOT touch ticket map centering logic (county-centered unless pin-centered).
- Did NOT change custom pin sizing logic.
- Did NOT alter right-rail layout or table label resolver.
- Kept county outline behavior (simplify only when huge).

Files changed
- app.py
