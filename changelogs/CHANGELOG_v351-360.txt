CHANGELOG v351–360

v354 (2026-02-16)
- Home right-rail layout: split into two stacked cards again (Recent tickets mini-map card + Trending/Followed card)
- Mini-map restored to full-bleed inside its own card, matching the prior look while keeping the new cards below

v353 (2026-02-16)
- Attempted right-rail layout adjustments for new cards (superseded by v354)

v355 (2026-02-16)
- Right-rail cards: make panels sharp-edged (no rounded corners) and tighten Recent tickets header spacing
- Trending Counties: add robust fallback so the list populates even with sparse trend data (top overall counties)
