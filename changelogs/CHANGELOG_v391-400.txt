CHANGELOG v391–400

v391 (2026-02-18)
- Fix Render crash: remove duplicate Flask route registration for /api/state_geom/<stusps> (endpoint name collision).

[v392] Map page polish
- Add bottom breathing room so map card border isn’t flush with viewport
- Remove left filter rail inner scrollbar (match Home rail)
- Allow scroll-wheel zoom without CTRL on interactive map (gestureHandling=greedy)
- Right panel stats header shows selected county/state (or prompt when none); remove helper text

[v393] Map page selection + rail overflow fix
- Treat focus_county_geoid navigation the same as county_geoid filter so the right panel title matches the outlined county (not just the state).
- Ensure the left filter rail does not show its own scrollbar by overriding the outer left-rail container overflow.
