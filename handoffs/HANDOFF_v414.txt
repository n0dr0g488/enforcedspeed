HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v414)

Goal (bugfix on v413)
- Ticket-card Static Maps: fix context pin icon sizing (gray/ghost pins were massive).
- Ghost pins: make them ~25% less ghosted and eliminate the pink-ish bleed on Static Maps.

What was wrong in v413
1) Ticket-card Static Maps used 64×64 context icons:
   - In-county: pin_outside_warmgray.png
   - Out-of-county: pin_outside_ghostgray.png
   Result: non-selected pins appeared huge compared to the selected red pin (which already used a 32×32 *_static icon).
2) Ghost pin looked “pink-ish” on Static Maps because its center was highly transparent, letting map colors bleed through.

What changed in v414
A) Static Maps context pin sizing
- app.py (county_static_map_url)
  - Static Maps marker icons now use app-served /static/img/pins and the 32×32 *_static variants:
    - Selected: pin_inside_deepred_static.png
    - In-focus: pin_outside_warmgray_static.png (NEW)
    - Out-of-focus: pin_outside_ghostgray_static.png (recreated at 32×32)
  - This guarantees the *_static files exist without requiring pin-host (R2) updates.

B) Ghost pins less ghosted (interactive + static)
- static/img/pins/pin_outside_ghostgray.png
  - Increased alpha by ~25% (less transparent).
- static/img/pins/pin_outside_ghostgray_static.png
  - Rebuilt from the updated ghost icon at 32×32.

Files added/changed
- app.py
- static/img/pins/pin_outside_warmgray_static.png (NEW)
- static/img/pins/pin_outside_ghostgray.png (alpha boosted)
- static/img/pins/pin_outside_ghostgray_static.png (32×32 rebuilt)
- VERSION.txt -> v414
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v411-420.txt updated

Non‑negotiable guardrails (still)
- Do NOT regress ticket card static maps rendering.
- Do NOT change county-centered static map framing logic.
- No runtime expensive geometry unions.

Render deploy note (still important)
- Do NOT set PORT manually in Render. Let Render provide $PORT.
- Start Command:
  gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT} --access-logfile - --error-logfile -
- Health check path: /healthz

Smoke tests
- Home feed: ticket static maps show red selected pin + correctly sized gray pins + correctly sized ghost pins.
- Map page: ghost pins are slightly more visible than before (still clearly de-emphasized).
- No new 500s.
