HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v418)

Primary change
- Render deploy stability hardening:
  - In production (FLASK_ENV=production), app no longer runs ensure_counties_schema() at process startup.
    This prevents DB wake/locks from delaying gunicorn binding to $PORT (causes “spinning deploy / no open ports detected”).
  - load_dotenv no longer overrides existing env vars (prevents accidental override of Render-provided vars like PORT).

Render must-haves (DO NOT DRIFT)
- Start Command (Render UI): gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT} --access-logfile - --error-logfile -
- Health check path: /healthz
- Do NOT set PORT manually anywhere (service env vars AND any Environment Group).

Local workflow
- Use es-up (app + worker).
- If local hangs: confirm Docker Desktop + Postgres container (localhost:5433) are up.

Smoke tests
- python -m py_compile app.py
- Home feed loads; ticket static maps render; minimap renders; Trending/Follow show names
- Map page loads; title pill works; zoom buttons work

Packaging
- ZIP has unique top-level folder name and VERSION.txt updated to v418.

Deploy observability (v418)
- /healthz returns "ok v### pid=..." so you can prove which build is responding during deploys.
- render.yaml includes healthCheckPath: /healthz to prevent drift.
