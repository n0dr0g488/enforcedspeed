HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v419)

What changed
- Added server-side caching for the Home right-rail minimap image endpoint:
  /api/home_minimap_staticmap

Why
- That endpoint was doing a DB scan + a Google Static Maps request on every hit.
- Now it caches the final PNG for 5 minutes (Redis if available, else /tmp), reducing load and Google spend.

Behavior
- Response headers:
  - Cache-Control: public, max-age=300
  - X-ES-Cache: HIT / MISS / BYPASS
- Optional cache-bust: add ?v=2 (or any string) to use a separate cache key.

Non-negotiable guardrails
- No changes to ticket card static map centering logic.
- No changes to custom pin sizing logic.
- No per-request geometry unions.

Smoke test
- python -m py_compile app.py
- Load Home and confirm minimap renders.
- Reload Home twice and confirm the second hit shows X-ES-Cache: HIT (via browser devtools Network headers).
