HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v423)

Change in this ZIP (ONE THEME)
- Profile: added optional vehicle fields (car brand, model, year).
  - Visible as a “Car:” pill on profiles when set.
  - Owners can edit these fields directly on their profile page.

Implementation notes
- Adds nullable columns to User (car_make, car_model, car_year).
- Uses existing ensure_schema additive behavior to add missing columns (no destructive migrations).
- Profile route now supports GET + POST (POST is owner-only; others get 403).

Files changed
- models.py
  - Adds User.car_make / car_model / car_year.
- forms.py
  - Adds ProfileCarForm.
- app.py
