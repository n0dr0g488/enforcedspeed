HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web v379 (based on v378; one-change-at-a-time, NO REGRESSIONS)

Change made (scoped)
- Home right-rail minimap: CONUS-focused framing + more padding so West Coast and Maine are not clipped.
  - Reduce rendered minimap height to save vertical space.
  - Crop top/bottom (CSS) and nudge focus slightly north to avoid showing Cuba.
  - Slightly expand/adjust Google Static Maps visible bounds (server-side) to keep coast + pins comfortably in-frame.

Why
- The minimap only needs to communicate CONUS context.
- Cropping saves vertical space in the right rail.
- Expanded bounds prevent pins/coastlines being cut off (WA/OR coast and Maine).

Guardrails respected (no-touch)
- Ticket card static maps still render on Home feed.
- Ticket static map centering logic unchanged (county-centered unless explicitly pin-centered).
- Custom pin sizing unchanged.
- Right-rail layout remains flush/sharp (no wrapper duplication).
- Trending/Follow tables still show county/state names (no GEOIDs).
- No expensive geometry unions added.

Files changed

  - /api/home_minimap_staticmap: adjust CONUS visible bounds and request image size 640x360 (still scale=2)

  - Ticket card static maps render (multiple cards)
  - Right-rail minimap renders, no Cuba, and WA/OR + Maine are not clipped
  - Trending list shows real county/state names
