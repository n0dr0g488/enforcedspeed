HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v417)

What changed (single-scope)
- Fix v416 deploy failure on Render: app.py had a SyntaxError ("return outside function") caused by an unindented schema-bootstrap gate + return app block at the end of create_app().
- v417 re-indents that block correctly inside create_app() so Gunicorn can import app.py.

Why it matters
- Render deploys were failing immediately at import time due to SyntaxError.

Guardrails (NO REGRESSIONS)
- Ticket card static maps must continue to render on Home feed.
- Static ticket map centering logic stays: county-centered unless explicitly pin-centered.
- Custom pin sizing stays (no massive pins).
- Trending/Follow tables must keep county/state names (never raw GEOIDs).

Render stability checklist
- Health Check Path: /healthz
- Start Command: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT} --access-logfile - --error-logfile -
- DO NOT set PORT manually in Render env vars (Render supplies it).

Required smoke tests (before any push)
- python -m py_compile app.py
- Run es-up locally
- Verify Home feed loads + ticket static maps render
- Verify Map page loads + pins render

Deploy ("going live")
- git add -A
- git commit -m "v417: fix create_app indentation (Render import SyntaxError)"
- git push
