HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v383, one-change-at-a-time, NO REGRESSIONS)

What changed (v383)
- FIX: Home right-rail minimap now crops top/bottom in the UI to save vertical space, WITHOUT changing the underlying static-map framing/zoom.
- Implemented exactly as requested: keep the existing CONUS “zoom” you liked, and crop between the black-line region by:
  - wrapping the <img> in a fixed-height container (overflow:hidden)
  - using object-fit:cover + object-position to nudge framing

Key behavior / guardrails (MUST NOT REGRESS)
- Ticket card static maps must continue to render on Home feed.
- Ticket static map centering logic stays: county-centered unless explicitly pin-centered.
- Custom pin sizing stays on ticket static maps (no “massive” pins).
- Right-rail layout stays: flush/sharp panel style (no wrapper duplication).
- Trending/Follow tables must keep county/state names (never fall back to raw GEOIDs).
- Do not recompute expensive geometry per request (no runtime unions).

Files changed
- templates/home_feed.html
  - Added CSS classes .minimap-crop and updated minimap markup to wrap the image.

Tuning knobs (if user wants slightly different crop)
- templates/home_feed.html:
  - .minimap-crop{ height:250px; }
  - .minimap-crop img{ object-position:50% 44%; }
  Adjust height and the 2nd percentage (Y) only — DO NOT touch backend minimap bounds unless explicitly asked.

Local workflow
- Use es-up (runs app + worker).
- If local site spins/hangs: confirm Docker Desktop + Postgres container is running (localhost:5433).

Packaging rules
- ZIP must have unique top-level folder: EnforcedSpeed_v383_2026-02-18_minimap_crop_wrapper/
- Include updated VERSION.txt, changelog block, and this handoff.

Going live (Render)
- Going live = commit + push to GitHub (Render deploys from Git).
- render.yaml start command must remain:
  gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
