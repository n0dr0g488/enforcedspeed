CHANGELOG v381–390

v381 (2026-02-18) — Render deploy hardening
- Pin Render runtime to Python 3.11.11 (via render.yaml) (carried forward)
- Harden build step: upgrade pip/setuptools/wheel, then install requirements with --prefer-binary to avoid long source builds
- Pin wheel-sensitive deps to known-good versions to prevent source compilation on Render (pillow-heif==0.18.0, PyMuPDF==1.24.0)
