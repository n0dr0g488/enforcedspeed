HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web v378 (based on v377; one-change)

Change made (scoped)
- Fix Render deploy “spinning / port scan timeout” by binding Gunicorn to Render’s $PORT in render.yaml:
  startCommand: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT

Why
- Render’s port scanner expects your service to listen on the PORT env var. Without an explicit bind, deploy can hang and show “No open HTTP ports detected”.

Guardrails respected (no-touch)
- Did NOT change ticket card static map generation, centering logic, or custom pin sizing.
- Did NOT change county polygon detail/simplification.
- Did NOT change minimap logic (only deploy config).

Files changed
- render.yaml
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v371-380.txt
- handoffs/HANDOFF_v378.txt

Render check
- After deploy, Render logs should show Gunicorn listening on 0.0.0.0:$PORT and the port scan should quickly detect the open port.
