HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v402)

Goal of v402 (single scoped change)
Ticket card clickability parity on Home feed:
- The (count) next to the State and County name should link exactly like the corresponding State/County name.
- The ticket static map thumbnail should be clickable and route exactly like clicking the County name.

What changed
- templates/home_feed.html
  - Precomputed two URLs per ticket card:
    - state_focus_url (same destination as the State name link)
    - county_focus_url (same destination as the County name link)
  - Wrapped the State and County (count) in anchors pointing to the same URL as their corresponding names.
  - Wrapped the static map <img> in an anchor that routes to county_focus_url (falls back to state_focus_url if county is missing).
  - Added minimal CSS so the count-link looks identical to the old non-link styling.

Files changed
- templates/home_feed.html
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v401-410.txt
- handoffs/HANDOFF_v402.txt

Non‑negotiable guardrails (do not regress)
- Home feed ticket card static maps must render.
- Static ticket map centering logic stays: county-centered unless explicitly pin-centered.
- Custom pin sizing stays (no massive pins).
- Right-rail layout stays: flush/sharp panel style.
- Trending/Follow tables keep county/state names (never GEOIDs).
- No runtime geometry unions per request.

Smoke tests (required)
1) python -m py_compile app.py
2) Run es-up
3) Verify:
   - Home: ticket card static maps render.
   - Home: clicking State name and its (count) goes to identical map focus.
   - Home: clicking County name and its (count) goes to identical map focus.
   - Home: clicking the ticket static map image routes to the same destination as the County link.
