CHANGELOG — EnforcedSpeed (v401–v410)

v401 — 2026-02-19 — Map page overlay rails centering
- Map page now uses the same "overlay rails" layout as Home (fixed left/right rails).
- Center map column is once again centered to the viewport, aligning perfectly with the header search bar.
- Preserves full-height rails and the symmetric top/bottom buffer around the map card.

v402 — 2026-02-20 — Ticket card links parity (counts + map)
- Home feed: the (count) next to State and County is now clickable and routes to the same map focus as the name.
- Home feed: the ticket static map thumbnail is now clickable and routes to the same map focus as the County link (falls back to State if needed).


v403 — 2026-02-20 — Remove PYTHON_VERSION from render.yaml
- render.yaml: removed the PYTHON_VERSION env var override (3.14.2) to avoid Render selecting an unsupported runtime.
- No application logic or UI changes.
