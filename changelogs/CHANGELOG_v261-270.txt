ENFORCEDSPEED CHANGELOG — v261–v270

v270 (2026-02-07)
- Fix filter rail HTML corruption that rendered raw CSS/HTML text in the sidebar and at page top.
- Fix State dropdown crash (25P02) by validating county GEOID inputs and adding db.session.rollback() on caught DB exceptions (prevents poisoned sessions).
- Make County filter behave correctly: submit on suggestion click, clear county when State changes, and apply county_geoid filter to /home + /api/map_pins + strictness calculations.
- Polish ticket card date: ensure it renders once, right-aligned under pills via flex-wrap/justify fixes.

v269 (2026-02-07)
- Fix CSS accidentally rendering as text at the top of the page (style tag placement).
- Remove duplicated bottom-of-card timestamp; show timestamp right-aligned under pills in the header.
- Keeps county filter sidebar markup clean (was being broken by the CSS spill).
