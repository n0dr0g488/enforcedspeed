HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v388, one-change-at-a-time, NO REGRESSIONS)

Base
- Based on v387 (minimap crop “bite” via img height > wrapper).

Change in v388 (single scoped UI tweak)
- Right-rail tables: tighten the 7d / 30d / 1y / Overage metric columns so long county,state labels fit better.
- Replace “Overage” header with stacked “Avg.” over “Overage” to keep column narrow.
- Applied consistently to BOTH:
  - Trending counties
  - Counties you follow

Files changed
- templates/home_feed.html
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v381-390.txt
- handoffs/HANDOFF_v388.txt

Guardrails preserved
- Ticket card static maps still render and keep existing centering + pin sizing.
- Right-rail panel remains flush/sharp style.
- Trending/Follow entries keep county/state names (no GEOID fallback).
- No expensive geometry recomputation changes.

Smoke test checklist
- Home feed loads
- Minimap still loads/crops correctly
- Trending counties: long label fits; metrics closer together
- “Avg.” appears above “Overage”
