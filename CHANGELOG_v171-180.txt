Consolidated changelog block (per handoff rule).
Note: v171 is not present in this ZIP history.

EnforcedSpeed v172 — Submit page row alignment fix (2026-01-29)

Changes
- Submit (/submit): Reworked the State / Road / Refine-pin inline row to use a grid layout so the Refine button's right edge aligns with the full-width fields below.
- Submit: Removed the "Logged in as / Not logged in" messaging and replaced with a single centered trust note (login/register links shown only when logged out).
- Submit: Reduced Refine-pin button prominence slightly.
- Submit: Updated Submit button to a slightly light-blue tint with a touch heavier weight (still modern/light).

ENFORCEDSPEED v173 — Filter Panel + Map Title + Rankings Title/Filters

Scope (requested):
1) Filter panel (Home + Map + Rankings):
   - Title: “Filter Speeding Tickets” (Title Case), unbolded and centered.
   - Replace “Order” section header with “Sort by”.
   - Remove the redundant “Sort by” label line to save vertical space (dropdown remains, now aria-labeled).

2) Map page:
   - Replace “Map” heading with: “EnforcedSpeed's Interactive Map”
   - Subtitle (centered, small): “Shows speeding tickets with a pinned location.”

3) Rankings (/strictness) page:
   - Add centered page title: “Most and Least Strict State and Road Combinations”
   - Keep description line, removing the parenthetical clause.
   - Add the same left filter panel used on Home/Map (no redesign).

ENFORCEDSPEED v174 — App launch hotfix (IndentationError)

Base: v173 (Filter panel + Map/Rankings titles)

Fix
- app.py: Restored correct indentation for the /tickets route decorator inside create_app().
  This fixes the startup crash:
    IndentationError: unexpected indent (def bucket_tickets)

Notes
- No visual/UI changes intended vs v173.
- ZIP packaged with a single unique top-level root folder name matching the version.


EnforcedSpeed v175 — Strictness filters fix (Rankings page)

Goal
- Make the Rankings (/strictness) page actually honor the shared filter rail inputs (not just State).

Changes
- app.py: Updated strictness_rows() to apply the same filter inputs as Home/Map before computing strictness rankings:
  - Road
  - Posted speed limit bucket(s)
  - Overage bucket(s)
  - Photo submitted / verification status
  - Date
  - Hide anonymous (members only)
  - Admin deleted-mode (hide/include/only)

Notes
- No visual/layout changes in this ZIP.


ENFORCEDSPEED v176 — Multi-select “Done” button fix (Map + Rankings)

Problem
- On /strictness (and /map), the multi-select dropdowns for “Posted speed limit” / “Overage” opened, but the “Done” button did not apply/close like it does on the Home feed.

Root cause
- The multi-select behavior JavaScript existed only on the Home feed page (bound to #feedFilters), so Map and Rankings had no handler for the “Done” button or auto-submit-on-close.

Fix
- templates/strictness.html: Added the same multi-select JS (bound to #strictnessFilters).
- templates/map_page.html: Added the same multi-select JS (bound to #mapFilters).

Notes
- No visual changes intended.
- ZIP packaged with a single unique top-level root folder matching the version name.


ENFORCEDSPEED v177 — 2026-01-29 — Filter panel compact note + ticket card copy/overage cleanup

Built from: EnforcedSpeed_v176_2026-01-29_multiselect_done_fix.zip (inspected directly; no guessing)

Changes
1) Filter panels (Home / Map / Rankings):
   - Move “(Must be logged in)” inline with “Hide anonymous” and change to “(must log in)”.
   - No change to admin deleted/show controls.

2) Ticket card EnforcedSpeed sentence:
   - Shortened copy and removed bolding.
   - New format: “On <ROAD> in <STATE>, 90% of all submitted tickets occurred at or above <X> mph.”

3) Ticket card overage display:
   - Move overage inline after “<ticketed> in a <posted>” as “(+X mph)” in the same blue color.

- Banner text: LEGAL NOTICE: Posted speed limits are the law. Obey posted speed limits. EnforcedSpeed is informational only.
- Adjusted top spacing so the banner sits directly above the first content card/container.


EnforcedSpeed v180 (2026-01-29)
- Filter panel: make '(must log in)' note non-bold (font-weight 400) and add a little spacing from 'Hide anonymous' (margin-left).
