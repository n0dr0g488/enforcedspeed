CHANGELOG v421–v430

v421
- Home feed infinite scroll polish:
  - Added a subtle loading row with a spinner and a clear end cap (“No more posts.”).
  - Preserves feed position on refresh (scroll + number of loaded batches stored in sessionStorage per filter query).
  - Defers ticket-card static map image requests until the card is near the viewport (IntersectionObserver + data-src), reducing initial load cost.


v422
- Map page: added a Follow/Following pill next to the centered region title pill when a county is the active focus.
  - Members can follow/unfollow the focused county directly from the map.
  - Follow state persists (updates Home “Counties you follow” list on next visit).
  - Safe table creation on demand (checkfirst) to avoid breaking older DBs.


v423
- Profile: added optional vehicle fields (car brand, model, year).
  - Visible on the profile header as a pill when set.
  - Owners can edit these fields directly on their profile page.


v424
- Profile: added saved Default Filters (state/county/date/photo/pin/speed/overage/sort).
  - Applied automatically when opening Home or Statistics with no filters.
  - Clear button now uses ?clear=1 to bypass defaults and show everything.


v425
- Profile: added built-in system avatars (picker + display across the site).
  - Users can pick from ~30 avatars on their profile.
  - Avatar shows next to usernames on posts/comments and in the header “My Profile” button.


v426
- Profile: added optional uploaded profile photo (1 max) stored in R2.
  - Upload is blocked unless Google Vision SafeSearch passes (adult/racy).
  - Auto-crops to square and stores 64px + 256px JPEG sizes.
  - Photo displays everywhere avatars appear; remove button reverts to built-in avatar.


v427
- Profile photo upload hotfix:
  - Fixed profile photo URL construction (no more /profile_photos/profile_photos double path → images render correctly).
  - Increased default upload cap (Config.MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH now 30MB; PROFILE_PHOTO_MAX_BYTES default 25MB) so typical phone photos don’t hard-fail.
  - UI now shows a clear “File too large” message on 413.
