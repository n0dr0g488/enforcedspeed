HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v411)

Purpose
- Fix Render “spinning deploy” where logs show repeated GET / 200 while Render reports:
  "No open HTTP ports detected on 0.0.0.0".

Root cause (most likely)
- App was doing DB schema bootstrap during create_app() startup (ensure_counties_schema()).
- If Postgres is slow/locked/waking up, Gunicorn may not bind to $PORT quickly enough → Render times out port detection.

What changed (v411)
- Disabled DB schema work at boot by default.
- Added env gate:
  ES_BOOTSTRAP_DB_ON_START=1  (ONLY when you intentionally need additive schema setup; keep OFF in production)

Render must-haves (do not drift)
- Start Command (Render UI):
  gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT} --access-logfile - --error-logfile -
- Health check path: /healthz
- Prefer NOT setting PORT manually; let Render provide $PORT.

Smoke tests
- Local: python -m py_compile app.py
- Run es-up
- Verify Home loads, ticket card static maps render, right-rail minimap loads, Trending tables show names, Map page loads.

Git deploy
- Going live = commit + push to GitHub (Render deploys from Git).
