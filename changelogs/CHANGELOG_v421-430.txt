CHANGELOG v421–v430

v421
- Home feed infinite scroll polish:
  - Added a subtle loading row with a spinner and a clear end cap (“No more posts.”).
  - Preserves feed position on refresh (scroll + number of loaded batches stored in sessionStorage per filter query).
  - Defers ticket-card static map image requests until the card is near the viewport (IntersectionObserver + data-src), reducing initial load cost.


v422
- Map page: added a Follow/Following pill next to the centered region title pill when a county is the active focus.
  - Members can follow/unfollow the focused county directly from the map.
  - Follow state persists (updates Home “Counties you follow” list on next visit).
  - Safe table creation on demand (checkfirst) to avoid breaking older DBs.


v423
- Profile: added optional vehicle fields (car brand, model, year).
  - Visible on the profile header as a pill when set.
  - Owners can edit these fields directly on their profile page.
