HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v384)

Single change

- Adds a fast, DB-independent health check route: GET /healthz -> "ok" (200).

Why

- Render deploys were intermittently getting stuck in the "No open HTTP ports detected" scanning phase despite Gunicorn listening.
- A tiny health endpoint lets you set Render Health Check Path to /healthz (recommended) so deploy readiness is deterministic and does not depend on rendering the full home page.

Files changed

- app.py
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v381-390.txt
- handoffs/HANDOFF_v384.txt

Render action required (one-time)

- In Render Web service settings, set Health Check Path to: /healthz
- Keep Start Command: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT

Guardrails preserved

- No changes to ticket card static maps, centering logic, pin sizing, right-rail layout, or tables.
