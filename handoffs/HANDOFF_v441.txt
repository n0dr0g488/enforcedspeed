HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v441)

Theme: Home clickwrap + submit tile (one change)

What changed
- Home page now shows a blocking clickwrap modal on first visit:
  - Reuses the exact “Welcome to EnforcedSpeed…” copy that used to live in the first tile.
  - Adds: “By using this service you agree to our Terms, Privacy, and Cookie Policy” (links open in new tab).
  - Requires an unchecked “I agree” checkbox, then “Continue” (button disabled until checked).
  - Small footer: “Log in to prevent this message again.”

Persistence
- Acceptance is stored client-side:
  - localStorage key: es_clickwrap_v1 = "1"
  - cookie fallback (SameSite=Lax, 180 days)

Home feed first tile
- The previous Welcome/CTA tile is replaced by a large, intuitive submit tile:
  - Blue card, large white ring and white plus inside.
  - Same link target as before (register->submit for logged-out, submit for logged-in).

Files touched
- templates/home_feed.html
- templates/_mvp_styles.html
- VERSION.txt

Guardrails respected
- No changes to ticket card static maps, minimap logic, or trending tables.
- No deployment/start-command changes.
