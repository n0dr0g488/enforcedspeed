HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web v368 (based on v366 baseline)

Change scope (ONE change only)
- Home right-rail Trending counties + Counties you follow tables: added an "Overage" column.
- Overage values show the median ticket overage for that county over the last 365 days, formatted like "+7mph".

Implementation notes
- Backend computes counts (7d/30d/1y) as before.
- Added a best-effort median overage calculation:
  - Postgres: uses percentile_cont(0.5) within group (ORDER BY overage) with created_at >= now-365d.
  - Non-Postgres fallback: fetches overage values for only the displayed counties and computes median in Python.
- County/state labels still come from counties table (namelsad/stusps) so full names remain visible.

Guardrails checked
- No changes to ticket card static map endpoints or centering logic.
- No changes to minimap custom pin sizing or right-rail layout structure.

Local smoke test commands
- python -m py_compile app.py
- es-up
- Verify: Home feed loads; ticket card static images still appear; right-rail minimap loads; tables show full county names + new Overage column.
