HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v440 — strictness/statistics fix, based on v428)

Base ZIP
- Started from: EnforcedSpeed_v428_2026-02-22_avatar_photo_polish.zip

What changed (single fix)
- Fixed the Statistics/Strictness page 500 by restoring the missing helper `strictness_rows()` in app.py.
  - Root cause: the strictness_rows logic was accidentally pasted below `profile()` after a `return render_template(...)`,
    making it unreachable and leaving no `strictness_rows` symbol in scope. `/strictness` and `/api/strictness`
    called it and crashed.
  - Fix: moved that logic into a real `def strictness_rows(...):` at module scope (inside create_app), and added a small
    base query initialization (q = SpeedReport.query + required filters).

No other changes
- No template changes.
- No map logic changes.
- No Render/deploy config changes.

Smoke checks
- `python -m py_compile app.py` passes
- /strictness should load
- /statistics redirects to /strictness
- Home feed should be unchanged (ticket card static maps still render)

Deploy reminder
- “Going live” = commit + push; then verify https://enforcedspeed.com/healthz shows v440 and /strictness loads.
