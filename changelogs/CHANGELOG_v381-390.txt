CHANGELOG v381–v390

v383 — 2026-02-18 — Home minimap crop (UI-only)
- Home right-rail minimap now crops top/bottom via a fixed-height wrapper (overflow hidden).
- Underlying Google Static Maps framing/zoom/bounds remain unchanged (no minimap “zoom” tweaks).
- Keeps flush/sharp right-rail styling; crop is controlled by CSS (easy to tune via height/object-position).

v384 — 2026-02-18 — Add /healthz endpoint for Render
- Adds a fast, DB-independent /healthz route for reliable health checks during Render deploys.

v387 — 2026-02-18 — Minimap crop “bite” (UI-only)
- Home right-rail minimap crop now actually clips by rendering the image taller than the wrapper (height:130%) while wrapper stays fixed-height (235px).
- Tune crop position via object-position (now 50% 42%) without changing backend map framing.
