CHANGELOG v421–v430

v421
- Home feed infinite scroll polish:
  - Added a subtle loading row with a spinner and a clear end cap (“No more posts.”).
  - Preserves feed position on refresh (scroll + number of loaded batches stored in sessionStorage per filter query).
  - Defers ticket-card static map image requests until the card is near the viewport (IntersectionObserver + data-src), reducing initial load cost.
