CHANGELOG v381–v390

v382 (2026-02-18) — Home right-rail minimap: restore crispness + proper CONUS crop
- Home minimap static map: request a taller, higher-resolution image (640x420, scale=2) so the UI can crop without blurring.
- CONUS framing: adjust visible bounds northward (no Cuba) while keeping light Canada + extra east padding so Maine isn't clipped.
- CSS crop focus: move object-position upward to match the intended CONUS-only view.
