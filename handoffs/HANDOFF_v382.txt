HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v382, one-change-at-a-time, NO REGRESSIONS)

Goal (single change)
- Fix the home right-rail minimap regression from v379: restore crisp resolution and achieve the intended CONUS crop (no Cuba) without clipping WA/OR coast or Maine.

What changed (v382)
1) Higher-resolution minimap image request (server)
- /api/home_minimap_staticmap now requests size=640x420 with scale=2.
- This provides more pixel density so the UI can crop to 300px tall without looking blurry.

2) Better CONUS framing (server)
- Adjusted the Google Static Maps visible box:
  - SW: 25.0,-129.5
  - NE: 50.8,-60.5
- Biases view northward (keeps Cuba out), keeps a small slice of Canada, adds east padding so Maine doesn't get clipped.

3) Crop focus (client)
- Home right-rail minimap <img> uses object-fit:cover and object-position moved to 50% 28% (upward) to match the intended framing.

Guardrails verified / unchanged
- Ticket card static maps still render.
- Ticket static map centering logic unchanged (county-centered unless pin-centered).
- Custom pin sizing unchanged.
- Right-rail panel remains flush/sharp.
- Trending/Follow tables still show county/state names.
