HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v418)

Goal
- Make Render deploy verification unambiguous.

What changed
1) /healthz returns build + pid
- Response now: ok v418 pid=<number>
- This proves whether the NEW deploy instance is the one answering health checks.

2) render.yaml pins healthCheckPath
- Added: healthCheckPath: /healthz
- Prevents drift if you ever re-sync via Render Blueprint.

Render guardrails (DO NOT DRIFT)
- Start Command (Render UI): gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT} --access-logfile - --error-logfile -
- Health Check Path (Render UI): /healthz
- Do NOT set PORT manually anywhere (service env vars or Environment Group).

Verification
- Visit /healthz and confirm it shows: ok v418 pid=...
- During deploy, logs should show GET /healthz 200 with response bytes > 2.

Git
- Render deploys from GitHub, so changes go live after commit + push.
