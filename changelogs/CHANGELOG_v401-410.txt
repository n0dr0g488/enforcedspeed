CHANGELOG — EnforcedSpeed (v401–v410)

v401 — 2026-02-19 — Map page overlay rails centering
- Map page now uses the same "overlay rails" layout as Home (fixed left/right rails).
- Center map column is once again centered to the viewport, aligning perfectly with the header search bar.
- Preserves full-height rails and the symmetric top/bottom buffer around the map card.
