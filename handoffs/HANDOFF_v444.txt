HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web v444

Base: v443
Change scope (one tweak only)
- Home feed first blue “+” submit tile: make the plus stroke thickness match the white ring stroke.

What changed
- templates/_mvp_styles.html
  - Replaced percentage-based plus bar thickness with a fixed stroke variable (--plus-stroke: 4px)
  - Centered bars using calc(50% - stroke/2) so it scales cleanly.

Guardrails
- No changes to maps, minimap, trending tables, clickwrap logic, or routes.
