CHANGELOG — EnforcedSpeed (v401–v410)

v401 — 2026-02-19 — Map page overlay rails centering
- Map page now uses the same "overlay rails" layout as Home (fixed left/right rails).
- Center map column is once again centered to the viewport, aligning perfectly with the header search bar.
- Preserves full-height rails and the symmetric top/bottom buffer around the map card.

v402 — 2026-02-20 — Ticket card links parity (counts + map)
- Home feed: the (count) next to State and County is now clickable and routes to the same map focus as the name.
- Home feed: the ticket static map thumbnail is now clickable and routes to the same map focus as the County link (falls back to State if needed).


v403 — 2026-02-20 — Remove PYTHON_VERSION from render.yaml
- render.yaml: removed the PYTHON_VERSION env var override (3.14.2) to avoid Render selecting an unsupported runtime.
- No application logic or UI changes.

v404 — 2026-02-20 — Preserve scroll position on Like/Comment
- Home feed: liking, posting a comment/reply, or deleting a comment no longer jumps the page back to the top after the POST/redirect.
- Implementation: store the current scroll/card position in sessionStorage on submit, then restore it after reload.

v405 — 2026-02-20 — Fix preserve-scroll bindings
- Home feed: preserve-scroll now binds reliably by using a CSS class on Like/Comment/Delete forms (instead of matching URL substrings).
- Home feed: delete reply (nested) forms now include the hidden next=... field so redirects return to the same page state.


v406 — 2026-02-20 — Home feed CTA + welcome card styling
- Home feed: "Welcome to EnforcedSpeed" block is now a standard rounded feed card (matches ticket cards).
- Home feed: added a thin "Post your ticket" (+) CTA card below the welcome block linking to Submit a Ticket.

v407 — 2026-02-20 — Merge Welcome + CTA into one tile
- Home feed: removed the separate thin "Post your ticket" card.
- Home feed: the Welcome card is now clickable; routes to Submit if logged in, otherwise to Create Account and then on to Submit via next=/submit.
- Home feed: added a short CTA line under the title and tightened the welcome card spacing/line-height.

v408 — 2026-02-20 — Welcome tile inline CTA + arrow icon
- Home feed: moved the CTA text to the right of "Welcome to EnforcedSpeed" on the same line, separated by an em dash.
- Home feed: added a small right-arrow icon next to the CTA text.
- Home feed: tightened the welcome body text spacing/line-height to keep the tile compact.
