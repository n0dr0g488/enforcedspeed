HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v381 — Render deploy hardening, NO UI/logic changes)

Goal
- Stop recurring Render “Deploying…” hangs by preventing slow/fragile source builds and keeping runtime stable.

What changed (single scope: deploy reliability)
1) render.yaml
- buildCommand now upgrades pip/setuptools/wheel, then installs requirements with --prefer-binary:
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel && pip install --prefer-binary -r requirements.txt
- startCommand remains:
  gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
- PYTHON_VERSION remains pinned to 3.11.11.

2) requirements.txt
- Pin wheel-sensitive dependencies to known-good versions to avoid source compilation:
  pillow-heif==0.18.0
  PyMuPDF==1.24.0

Guardrails respected
- No changes to ticket card static maps, centering logic, pin sizing, right-rail layout, or tables.

Smoke test checklist
- python -m py_compile app.py
- Local: es-up
- Prod: Deploy in Render, verify build logs show Python 3.11.11 and pip installing wheels quickly.

Going live (definition)
- Commit + push to GitHub (Render deploys from Git).

If Render still “deploys” indefinitely
- Check Render build logs to see whether it’s hanging in Build or Start.
- If Build: look for any package compiling from source; pin it or force wheels.
- If Start: check runtime logs for crash-loop (missing env vars, DB connect, etc.).
