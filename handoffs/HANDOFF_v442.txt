HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web v442 (Clickwrap DB acceptance + thinner “+” tile)

Base
- Built strictly on v441 (no other feature work).

What changed (only these items)
1) Clickwrap acceptance is now DB-backed for logged-in users
- Added users.tos_accepted_at (timestamp) and users.tos_version (string).
- Added CLICKWRAP_TOS_VERSION constant (currently: 2026-02-22).
- Home page clickwrap now considers BOTH:
  - server acceptance (logged-in users)
  - localStorage/cookie (device)
- When a logged-in user clicks Continue, client POSTs to /api/accept_terms and stores:
  - tos_accepted_at = utcnow
  - tos_version = CLICKWRAP_TOS_VERSION

2) First “submit +” tile is now thin (FB-like row)
- Reduced tile height to a fixed ~96px desktop / 84px mobile.
- Kept the same link destination as before.

Important fix included (within the same clickwrap theme)
- v441 had a broken <script> injection inside the pin-refine JS block in templates/home_feed.html.
- v442 repairs that so pin refine JS is syntactically valid again and the clickwrap script lives outside that block.

Smoke checklist
- /healthz returns v442
- Home loads: ticket static maps still render
- Clickwrap appears for new users, can be dismissed
- Logged-in users who accept should not be prompted again (even on a fresh browser) once DB is updated
- Pin refine modal (if used) still works (no JS console syntax errors)

DB / Migration notes
- This repo includes a conservative runtime schema patcher that auto-adds missing columns.
  => On Render, deploying v442 will typically add users.tos_accepted_at + users.tos_version automatically at startup.

If you WANT a formal migration anyway (optional)
- Local:
  flask db migrate -m "add tos acceptance fields"
  flask db upgrade
- Render:
  run the same upgrade via a one-off shell/command runner if you use it, or deploy and rely on schema patcher.

Files touched
- models.py (User: tos_accepted_at, tos_version)
- app.py (CLICKWRAP_TOS_VERSION, /api/accept_terms, pass server acceptance to template)
- templates/home_feed.html (fixed broken script, DB-backed clickwrap POST)
- templates/_mvp_styles.html (thin + tile sizing)
- VERSION.txt
