HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web v372 (based on v371; one-change)

Change made (scoped)
- Restore custom static pin icon on server-proxied Static Maps:
  - Ticket card static maps
  - Right-rail minimap (uses same /api/county_staticmap endpoint)

Why
- After moving Static Maps behind the proxy and locking keys down, the proxy route was still calling
  county_static_map_url(..., use_custom_icon=False), which forces Google’s default marker.

Guardrails respected
- Did NOT change static map centering logic (county-centered unless explicitly pin-centered).
- Did NOT change ticket card map URL generation (still /api/county_staticmap).
- Did NOT change minimap layout or right-rail structure.

Files changed
- app.py
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v371-380.txt

Smoke test
- python -m py_compile app.py
- Load Home feed: ticket static images show custom pin icon (not Google default)
- Right-rail minimap pins show custom icon
