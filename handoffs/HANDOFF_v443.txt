HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (Base: v442)

Change theme (single theme):
1) Clickwrap robustness fix
2) Make the blue “+” first tile half-height

What changed

A) Clickwrap robustness
Problem observed:
- In v442, the clickwrap HTML existed for everyone, but the JS that opens it was accidentally placed inside a conditional block that only rendered when:
  current_user.is_authenticated AND maps_api_key is present.
- Result: anonymous users (including friends / incognito not logged in) often never saw the clickwrap.

Fix:
- Moved the clickwrap JS out of that conditional so it always runs for both anonymous and logged-in users.
- Still uses DB-backed acceptance for logged-in users (users.tos_accepted_at + users.tos_version) and localStorage/cookie for anonymous.

B) “+” first tile sizing
- Reduced the blue “+” tile height to ~half of v442 by changing --plus-card-h in templates/_mvp_styles.html:
  Desktop: 48px (was 96px)
  Mobile: 42px (was 84px)
- Slightly reduced ring border thickness (5px -> 4px) so it still looks balanced.

Guardrails
- No changes to ticket maps, centering logic, right rail, or county names.

Deploy
- Going live = git add/commit/push, then confirm /healthz shows v443.
- Confirm clickwrap appears for new/anonymous users (incognito) and persists in DB for logged-in users.
