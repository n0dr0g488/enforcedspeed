      <p class="policy-lead">
        EnforcedSpeed is a user-submitted data platform. We use the information you submit to calculate and display road-level enforcement patterns (for example, the “EnforcedSpeed” for a road and state).
      </p>

      <h3>Information you provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Ticket data you type in</b> (road, state, posted speed, cited speed, date, and optional notes).</li>
        <li><b>Account info</b> if you create an account (username and login credentials).</li>
        <li><b>Optional ticket photo</b> if you upload one for OCR-based verification.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ticket photos and OCR verification</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you upload a photo, we process it to verify the submitted ticket details.</li>
        <li><b>Photos are deleted within 24 hours</b> of upload (we do not intend to retain ticket photos long-term).</li>
        <li>We keep only the verification result (for example, “Auto-Extracted” / “Submitted”) and non-sensitive derived fields needed to operate the site.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How we use information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and operate the site, including computing and displaying aggregated enforcement statistics.</li>
        <li>Maintain security, prevent fraud/abuse, and enforce site rules.</li>
        <li>Troubleshoot and improve performance and usability.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you about your account or support requests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with service providers that help us run the site (for example: hosting, databases, background jobs, and OCR processing) but only as needed to provide the service.
      </p>

      <h3>Public content</h3>
      <p>
        Ticket posts may be visible to others depending on the visibility options you choose. Do not include personal identifiers in notes or uploads (names, addresses, driver’s license numbers, citation numbers, etc.).
      </p>

      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        We use cookies and similar technologies for basic functionality (such as login sessions) and to help keep the site secure.
      </p>

      <h3>Data retention</h3>
      <p>
        We keep submitted ticket data and account information for as long as needed to operate the platform, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. You may request deletion of your account or content (subject to reasonable operational and legal constraints).
      </p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        We use reasonable safeguards to protect information, but no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.
      </p>

      <h3>Children</h3>
      <p>
        EnforcedSpeed is not intended for children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes</h3>
      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date above indicates when it was most recently revised.
