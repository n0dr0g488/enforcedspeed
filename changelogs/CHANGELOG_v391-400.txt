CHANGELOG v391–400

v391 (2026-02-18)
- Fix Render crash: remove duplicate Flask route registration for /api/state_geom/<stusps> (endpoint name collision).

[v392] Map page polish
- Add bottom breathing room so map card border isn’t flush with viewport
- Remove left filter rail inner scrollbar (match Home rail)
- Allow scroll-wheel zoom without CTRL on interactive map (gestureHandling=greedy)
- Right panel stats header shows selected county/state (or prompt when none); remove helper text

[v393] Map page selection + rail overflow fix
- Treat focus_county_geoid navigation the same as county_geoid filter so the right panel title matches the outlined county (not just the state).
- Ensure the left filter rail does not show its own scrollbar by overriding the outer left-rail container overflow.

[v394] Map page left rail + spacing (attempt)
- Make Map page left filter panel include footer links/meta like Home and reduce scroll behavior.
- Add additional bottom breathing room so the map container border isn’t flush with the viewport.

[v395] Fix Map page Cookie Policy footer link
- Fix footer link endpoint to use url_for('cookies') to prevent /map 500.

[v396] Map page viewport lock + symmetric buffer (attempt)
- Lock Map page to viewport and reduce unwanted scrolling; aim for symmetric map container spacing.

[v397] Map page left rail parity + symmetric map buffer
- Left rail now matches Home: footer links/meta always visible; filter content can scroll if needed but scrollbar is hidden.
- Map container now has symmetric outer buffer (top/bottom) so the bottom border is clearly visible.
