HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v421)

Change in this ZIP (ONE THEME)
- Home feed infinite-scroll polish + performance:
  1) Loading row includes spinner + “No more posts” end cap.
  2) Refresh restores your feed position (scroll + number of loaded batches).
  3) Ticket-card static maps lazy-load (don’t request /api/county_staticmap until near viewport).

Why
- Faster initial home load (fewer static map requests up front) while keeping the Facebook-style infinite feed UX.

Files changed
- templates/base.html
  - Adds documentElement “js” class for progressive enhancement (used to hide fallback pagination when JS is enabled).
- templates/home_feed.html
  - Spinner/end cap styling + improved infinite-scroll JS (restore state + invoke lazy loader on appended content).
- templates/_feed_items.html
  - Ticket static map <img> uses placeholder src + data-src to enable IntersectionObserver lazy-loading.

Verification (required)
- python -m py_compile app.py
- Run es-up
- Home:
  - Initially loads 5 posts
  - Scroll down → loads additional batches
  - Loading spinner row shows while fetching
  - When no more posts: shows “No more posts.”
  - Refresh mid-feed → returns to roughly the same scroll position and same loaded depth
  - Ticket static maps still appear normally as you scroll (no regressions)
- /healthz shows “ok v421 pid=…”

Render note (deploy sanity)
- If Render UI “spins,” check https://enforcedspeed.com/healthz for the live version string; that’s the source of truth.
