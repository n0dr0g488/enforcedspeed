HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v407)

Goal of v407
Merge the Home feed intro + CTA into a single clickable Welcome tile:
- Remove the separate thin "+ Post your ticket" card.
- Make the Welcome card itself the CTA:
  - If logged in → goes directly to Submit Ticket.
  - If logged out → goes to Create Account and then continues to Submit Ticket via next=/submit.
- Add a short CTA line under the title and tighten spacing so the tile stays compact.

What changed
- templates/home_feed.html
  - Removed the thin post-CTA card.
  - Converted the Welcome card into an <a> (clickable tile).
  - Uses a safe next param: /register?next=/submit when logged out.
  - Added CTA line text: "Click this tile to create an account and post your ticket."

- templates/_mvp_styles.html
  - Removed post-CTA card CSS.
  - Added welcome tile link styling + hover affordance.
  - Tightened Welcome card padding and line-height.

Smoke tests (required)
1) python -m py_compile app.py
2) Run es-up
3) Home feed:
   - Only ONE intro tile at the top (no separate thin CTA card).
   - Clicking the Welcome tile:
     - Logged out: lands on Create Account, then after registration goes to /submit.
     - Logged in: goes straight to /submit.
   - Like/comment still does NOT jump to top (v405).
4) Verify NO regressions:
   - Ticket card static maps still render
   - Right-rail minimap renders
   - Trending/follow tables show names (not GEOIDs)
