CHANGELOG v381–v390

v383 — 2026-02-18 — Home minimap crop (UI-only)
- Home right-rail minimap now crops top/bottom via a fixed-height wrapper (overflow hidden).
- Underlying Google Static Maps framing/zoom/bounds remain unchanged (no minimap “zoom” tweaks).
- Keeps flush/sharp right-rail styling; crop is controlled by CSS (easy to tune via height/object-position).

v384 — 2026-02-18 — Add /healthz endpoint for Render
- Adds a fast, DB-independent /healthz route for reliable health checks during Render deploys.

v385 — 2026-02-18 — Home minimap: zoom in 1 + CONUS crop (UI)
- Zooms the right-rail minimap in one step by tightening the CONUS visible bounds on the static map request.
- Crops top/bottom in the UI (fixed-height wrapper + object-fit) to remove Mexico/Cuba and save vertical space.

- v386 (2026-02-18): Minimap cache-bust so crop/zoom changes always take effect (no-store + ?v=386 + cb).
