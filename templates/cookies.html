      <p>Effective date: February 13, 2026</p>
      <p>Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>
      <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Mindra LLC (“Mindra,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) as operator of EnforcedSpeed and the website at https://enforcedspeed.com, including any subdomains, features, content, and services offered thereon (collectively, the “Platform” or “Services”), uses cookies and similar technologies on our website and the Services. Your use of the Platform and/or Services constitutes acceptance of this Cookie Policy.</p>
      <h3>1. WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h3>
      <p>Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a website. Cookies help websites to function, improve user experience, and provide information about site usage.</p>
      <p>We may also use similar technologies (e.g., local storage, pixels, SDKs) that perform similar functions.</p>
      <h3>2. COOKIES WE USE TODAY</h3>
      <p>Strictly necessary cookies are those required for the Services to work. These include:</p>
      <p>- Session / authentication cookies (to keep you logged in and maintain your session).</p>
      <p>- Security cookies (e.g., CSRF protection tokens and other anti‑tamper mechanisms).</p>
      <p>Without these cookies, core functions like logging in and submitting tickets will not work.</p>
      <p>We may also use limited functional storage to remember preferences (e.g., UI choices).</p>
      <h3>3. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES THAT MAY USE COOKIES</h3>
      <p>Some pages load third‑party services that may set their own cookies and collect information, including:</p>
      <p>- Google Maps / Places / Roads (map and location features). Your browser connects to Google to load map scripts and tiles.</p>
      <p>- Infrastructure providers (e.g., Cloudflare) may set operational/security cookies depending on your configuration (e.g., bot protection, rate limiting, or DDoS mitigation).</p>
      <p>These third parties operate under their own policies and we do not control their cookies.</p>
      <h3>4. YOUR CHOICES AND CONTROLS</h3>
      <p>Browser controls</p>
      <p>Most browsers allow you to block or delete cookies. If you block strictly necessary cookies, the Services may not function.</p>
      <p>Device controls</p>
      <p>Mobile devices may offer controls for limiting tracking or resetting advertising identifiers.</p>
      <h3>5. UPDATES</h3>
      <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date when we make changes. Your continued use of the Platform and/or Services after the effective date of revised terms constitutes acceptance of the changes.</p>
      <h3>6. CONTACT</h3>
      <p>Questions regarding this Cookie Policy may be directed to: contact@enforcedspeed.com</p>
