HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v422)

Change in this ZIP (ONE THEME)
- Map page: Follow/Following pill next to the centered region title pill when a COUNTY is the active focus.
  - Authenticated users can follow/unfollow the focused county directly from /map.
  - If not logged in, the pill links to login and returns to the same map view.
  - Follow state persists via user_follow_counties (updates Home “Counties you follow” list on next visit).

Implementation notes
- Uses FollowedCounty model (models.py) and creates the table on demand with checkfirst=True to avoid breaking older DBs.
- Adds a small CSRF-protected JSON endpoint used by the map pill.

Files changed
- app.py
  - Adds /api/follow_status and /api/toggle_follow_county endpoints.
  - map_view passes follow context (county geoid + initial following state) to template.
- forms.py
  - Adds FollowCountyForm (CSRF only + county_geoid).
- templates/map_page.html
  - Adds Follow/Following pill UI and JS handler.

Verification (required)
- python -m py_compile app.py
- Run es-up
- Map page:
  - Open a county-focused map URL (e.g., /map?focus_county_geoid=51153&focus_state=VA)
  - See the Follow pill next to the region title pill.
  - Click Follow → becomes Following.
  - Refresh → still Following.
  - Home right rail “Counties you follow” shows the new county.
- /healthz shows “ok v422 pid=…”
