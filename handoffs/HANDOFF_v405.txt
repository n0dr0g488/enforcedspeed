HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v405)

Goal of v405 (single scoped fix)
Make the v404 “preserve scroll on Like/Comment/Delete” behavior actually trigger reliably.

Root cause of v404 not working
- The JS bound submit listeners using action substring matches:
    form[action*="toggle_like"], form[action*="add_comment"], ...
- But the actual Flask routes are:
    /like/<id>
    /comment/<id>
    /comment/<id>/delete
  so those substring selectors never matched, and the handler never ran.

What changed
- templates/home_feed.html
  - Added class="js-preserve-scroll" to:
    - Like form
    - Comment + Reply forms
    - Delete comment forms (including nested replies)
  - Updated JS binding to:
    document.querySelectorAll('form.js-preserve-scroll')
  - Added hidden next={{ request.full_path }} to nested reply delete forms so redirects preserve the current page/filters.

Files changed
- templates/home_feed.html
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v401-410.txt
- handoffs/HANDOFF_v405.txt

Smoke tests (required)
1) python -m py_compile app.py
2) Run es-up
3) Home feed:
   - Like a post: should return to the same card (no jump to top)
   - Post a comment/reply: no jump to top
   - Delete a comment (top-level + nested): no jump to top
4) Verify NO regressions:
   - Ticket card static maps still render
   - Right-rail minimap renders
   - Trending/Follow tables show names (not GEOIDs)
