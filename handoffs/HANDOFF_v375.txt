HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web v375 (based on v374; one-change)

Change made (scoped)
- Static Maps (server-proxied ticket card maps + minimap): keep county outline required, but automatically simplify the county boundary encoded polyline when it exceeds a safe length budget.
  - Prevents Google Static Maps from returning the "Map error: g.co/staticmaperror" tile caused by overly-long path polylines.
  - Preserves custom pin icons (does not revert proxy/caching/server-key work).

Guardrails respected
- Did NOT touch ticket card centering logic (county-centered unless explicitly pin-centered).
- Did NOT change custom pin sizing/assets.
- Did NOT alter right-rail layout or table label logic.

Files changed
- app.py
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v371-380.txt
- handoffs/HANDOFF_v375.txt

Local smoke test
- python -m py_compile app.py
- es-up
- Verify:
  - Home feed: ticket card static maps render (no g.co/staticmaperror overlay)
  - Custom pin icons appear (not Google default)
  - County outline still present
  - Right-rail minimap renders
