HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v412)

What changed in v412 (single-scope stage)
- Stage 6 (Color scheme on interactive map pins):
  - Selected pin is now deep red (same as primary pin).
  - Pins inside the current focus (state/county) are mid-gray.
  - Pins outside the focus are the same gray but ghosted.
  - Removed use of the yellow selected pin on the interactive map.
- Added local asset used by the interactive map:
  - static/img/pins/pin_outside_ghostgray.png (+ _static copy)

Files touched
- templates/map_page.html
- static/img/pins/pin_outside_ghostgray.png

Guardrails (NO REGRESSIONS)
- Ticket card static maps must continue to render on Home feed.
- Static ticket map centering logic stays county-centered unless explicitly pin-centered.
- Custom pin sizing stays (no massive pins).
- Right-rail layout stays flush/sharp (no wrapper duplication).
- Trending/Follow tables must keep county/state names (never raw GEOIDs).
- No expensive geometry unions at request time.

Render / deployment hygiene (IMPORTANT)
- Do NOT set PORT manually in Render (remove PORT from service env vars AND any Environment Group).
  Render provides $PORT dynamically; app must bind to 0.0.0.0:${PORT}.
- Start Command (Render UI):
  gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT} --access-logfile - --error-logfile -
- Health check path: /healthz

Smoke tests
- python -m py_compile app.py
- es-up
- Verify:
  - Home feed loads; ticket card static maps show.
  - Home minimap shows.
  - Map page loads; zoom buttons still work; title pill still works.
  - Interactive pins: selected is red; in-focus pins are gray; out-of-focus pins are ghost gray.

Packaging rules
- ZIP must have unique top-level root folder.
- Include VERSION.txt + changelog block + handoff.
- After ZIP link: include git add/commit/push.
