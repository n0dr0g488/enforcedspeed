HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v398)

What changed (single scoped change: layout/spacing)

1) Home + Statistics left filter rail now matches Map page “flush to bottom” look.
- Changed the fixed left rail to use top:62px + bottom:0 (no extra bottom gap).
- Made .filters-rail a full-height flex column:
  - .filters-scroll is the scroll area (scrollbar hidden)
  - .filters-footer is pinned to the bottom
- Updated templates:
  - templates/home_feed.html
  - templates/strictness.html
  - templates/map_page.html (left rail structure updated to match)

2) Map page bottom buffer fix (symmetric top/bottom outer padding)
- Root cause: fixed-position side rails + 100% height children can “eat” the shell padding and visually clip the bottom spacing.
- Fix: Map page now uses an in-flow 3-column flex layout inside a viewport-locked padded shell.
  - Side rails are NOT fixed on Map page anymore (only on Home/Stats).
  - The shell has padding:12px on all sides and a height of calc(100vh - 62px), so the bottom padding always renders.

Non‑negotiable guardrails (do not regress)
- Home feed ticket card static maps must render.
- Static ticket map centering logic stays: county-centered unless explicitly pin-centered.
- Custom pin sizing stays (no massive pins).
- Right-rail layout stays: flush/sharp panel style.
- Trending/Follow tables keep county/state names (never GEOIDs).
- No runtime geometry unions per request.

Smoke tests (required)
1) python -m py_compile app.py
2) Run es-up
3) Verify:
   - Home: left filter panel extends flush to bottom; footer links pinned at bottom; filters still work.
   - Statistics: left filter panel extends flush to bottom; footer links pinned at bottom.
   - Map page: visible, symmetric outer padding (top and bottom) around the map card; bottom border is clearly visible.
   - No console/server errors.
   - Home ticket card static maps still render; minimap still renders; Trending shows names.

Render / Going live
- Going live = git commit + git push to GitHub (Render deploys from Git).
- If Render “spins”: confirm Start Command + PORT=10000 + /healthz, then clear build cache once.

Notes
- Map page now hides the base footer (footer links are in the left rail).
