HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v404)

Goal of v404 (single scoped change)
Stop the Home feed from snapping back to the top after Like / Comment / Reply / Delete-comment actions.

Root cause
- These actions are standard POST forms that redirect back to the Home feed.
- After redirect, the browser resets scroll position to the top.
- Additionally, the Enter-to-submit helper used form.submit(), which bypasses submit event listeners.

What changed
- templates/home_feed.html
  - Added id="ticket-{{ r.id }}" to each ticket card so we can restore to the exact card.
  - Added a small scroll-preservation helper:
    - On submit of Like / Add Comment / Delete Comment forms, store scroll + card id in sessionStorage.
    - On page load, restore scroll (prefer card scrollIntoView).
  - Updated the Enter-to-submit helper to:
    - Save scroll state first
    - Use requestSubmit() when available (fallback to submit())

Files changed
- templates/home_feed.html
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v401-410.txt
- handoffs/HANDOFF_v404.txt

Smoke tests (required)
1) python -m py_compile app.py
2) Run es-up
3) Home feed:
   - Like a post: page should return to the same card (no jump to top)
   - Post a comment/reply: no jump to top
   - Delete a comment: no jump to top
4) Verify NO regressions:
   - Ticket card static maps still render
   - Right-rail minimap renders
   - Trending/Follow tables show names (not GEOIDs)

Render / Going live
Going live = commit + push to GitHub (Render deploys from Git).
