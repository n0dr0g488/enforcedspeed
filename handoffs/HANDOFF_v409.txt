HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v409)

Goal of v409
Stage 4 (Map UX): Add a centered title pill on top of the interactive map that matches the outlined scope.
- If a county is outlined: show that county label.
- If a state is outlined: show the state name (e.g., Virginia (VA)).
- Otherwise: default to "United States".

What changed
- templates/map_page.html
  - Added a map-frame wrapper around the map with a centered "map-title-pill" overlay.
  - Pill text is driven by the existing server-side region_title (same value used in the right stats card).
  - Map container now fills the rounded map-frame via absolute positioning.

Files changed
- templates/map_page.html
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v401-410.txt
- handoffs/HANDOFF_v409.txt

Smoke tests (required)
1) python -m py_compile app.py
2) Run es-up
3) /map page:
   - Pill appears centered at the top of the map.
   - From Home: click a State → /map shows pill "<State Name> (<ST>)" and correct outline.
   - From Home: click a County → /map shows pill "<County>, <ST>" and correct outline.
   - Map remains viewport-locked and the map card bottom buffer is still visible.
4) Verify NO regressions:
   - Home feed ticket static maps still render
   - Right-rail minimap renders
   - Trending/follow tables show names (not GEOIDs)
