HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v445)

Base
- Built from v444.

Change (single-theme)
- Home feed first “blue +” submit tile: fix missing plus sign.

Root cause
- CSS pseudo-elements for .home-submit-plus-sign (::before/::after) had no content/background/positioning, so the bars never rendered.

Fix
- Added content:"", position:absolute, and background:#fff to the pseudo-elements.
- Kept stroke weight aligned with the ring (4px) as requested.

Guardrails
- No changes to ticket card static maps, centering, pin sizing, right-rail layout, or trending/follow tables.

Deploy
- Going live = commit + push (Render deploys from GitHub).
