HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v410)

Current status
- v410 adds Map page zoom buttons (+/−) inside the interactive map card.
- This is Stage 5 from the staged roadmap (Map UX: zoom controls for users without a mouse wheel).

What changed (scoped)
- templates/map_page.html
  - Added overlay zoom controls (bottom-right) inside .map-frame.
  - Wired buttons to ES_MAP.setZoom(±1) with safe clamp + disabled state.

Non‑negotiable guardrails (NO REGRESSIONS)
- Home feed ticket card static maps must render.
- Static ticket map centering logic stays: county-centered unless explicitly pin-centered.
- Custom pin sizing stays (no massive pins).
- Right-rail layout stays: flush/sharp panel style (no wrapper duplication).
- Trending/Follow tables must keep county/state names (never raw GEOIDs).
- No expensive geometry unions at request time (state/county boundaries must remain cached/precomputed).

Render / Going live
- Going live = commit + push to GitHub (Render deploys from Git).
- Web service Start Command must remain:
  gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT} --access-logfile - --error-logfile -
- Health check path: /healthz

Smoke tests (required)
- python -m py_compile app.py
- Run es-up
- Verify:
  - Home feed loads fast; ticket static maps appear
  - Right-rail minimap loads
  - Trending/Follow tables show names
  - Map page loads; title pill present; zoom buttons work (+/−)

Next stage suggestion
- Stage 6: unify pin colors across static ticket maps + minimap + interactive map (Selected red, in-county mid-gray, out-of-county ghosted). Keep it one-change and verify contrast.
