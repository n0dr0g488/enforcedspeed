HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web v373 (based on v371; one-change)

Change made (scoped)
- Fix ticket card + right-rail minimap static maps showing default Google pins + occasional g.co/staticmaperror.
  - /api/county_staticmap now requests custom icon markers again (use_custom_icon=True).
  - Added URL-length guard that preserves the county outline by auto-simplifying the encoded polyline
    only when the generated Google Static Maps URL would exceed a safe length.

Why
- In v371, the proxy forced use_custom_icon=False which always produced default pins.
- Some counties can generate very long Static Maps URLs; Google returns a staticmaperror tile when the
  URL is too long. Outline is required, so we simplify (not drop) the outline when necessary.

Guardrails respected
- Did NOT touch home-feed static map centering rules (county-centered unless explicitly pin-centered).
- Did NOT touch pin sizing assets.
- Did NOT change right-rail layout or trending/follow naming logic.

Local smoke test
- python -m py_compile app.py
- es-up
- Verify:
  - Home feed loads fast
  - Ticket card static images render and show custom pins
  - Right-rail minimap renders and shows custom pins
  - No g.co/staticmaperror tiles
