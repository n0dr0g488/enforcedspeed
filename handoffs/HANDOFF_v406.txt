HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v406)

Goal of v406 (Stage 3)
Polish the top of the Home feed:
1) Make the "Welcome to EnforcedSpeed" block use the same rounded feed-card styling as ticket cards.
2) Add a thin, Facebook-style CTA card: "+ Post your ticket" linking to Submit a Ticket.

What changed
- templates/home_feed.html
  - Replaced the Welcome block wrapper (was incorrectly using .filters-rail) with a standard .card wrapper.
  - Added a thin CTA card directly below the Welcome block:
      "Post your ticket" with a plus-in-circle icon, linking to url_for('submit').

- templates/_mvp_styles.html
  - Added small CSS helpers:
    - .home-welcome-card padding (keeps the Welcome card compact)
    - .post-cta-card layout + icon styling

Files changed
- templates/home_feed.html
- templates/_mvp_styles.html
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v401-410.txt
- handoffs/HANDOFF_v406.txt

Smoke tests (required)
1) python -m py_compile app.py
2) Run es-up
3) Home feed:
   - Welcome block is rounded like ticket cards (not a rail-styled rectangle).
   - "Post your ticket" thin card appears under Welcome and links to Submit a Ticket.
4) Verify NO regressions:
   - Ticket card static maps still render
   - Right-rail minimap renders
   - Like/comment does NOT jump to top (v405 behavior intact)
