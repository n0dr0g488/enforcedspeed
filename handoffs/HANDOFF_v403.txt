HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v403)

Goal of v403 (single scoped change)
Remove the PYTHON_VERSION override from render.yaml so Render does not attempt to use an unsupported Python runtime.

What changed
- render.yaml
  - Removed:
    - key: PYTHON_VERSION
      value: 3.14.2
  - This prevents blueprint-driven deploys from pinning to an invalid runtime.

Files changed
- render.yaml
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v401-410.txt
- handoffs/HANDOFF_v403.txt

Smoke tests (required)
1) python -m py_compile app.py
2) Run es-up
3) Verify Home feed + Map page load normally.

Render notes
- If your Render web service is blueprint-driven (uses render.yaml), removing PYTHON_VERSION prevents runtime mismatch startup failures.
- If your Render service is NOT blueprint-driven, this change is harmless.

Render / Going live
Going live = commit + push to GitHub (Render deploys from Git).
