CHANGELOG v381–v390

v383 — 2026-02-18 — Home minimap crop (UI-only)
- Home right-rail minimap now crops top/bottom via a fixed-height wrapper (overflow hidden).
- Underlying Google Static Maps framing/zoom/bounds remain unchanged (no minimap “zoom” tweaks).
- Keeps flush/sharp right-rail styling; crop is controlled by CSS (easy to tune via height/object-position).
