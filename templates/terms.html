      <h3>3. DESCRIPTION OF THE SERVICES</h3>
      <p>The Services include an online platform that allows Users to submit information relating to traffic or speeding tickets, including the optional upload of ticket images, and to receive automated extraction and verification of certain information through software-based technologies, including OCR and related Automated Processing.</p>
      <p>The Services are currently provided free of charge. Company does not charge users any fees for access to or use of the Services.</p>
      <h3>3. TICKET IMAGE SUBMISSIONS</h3>
      <p><b>3.1 Upload and Automated Image Processing</b></p>
      <p>Ticket Image uploads are analyzed to verify the information entered by the User regarding their ticket. Below is a technical description of the Ticket Image upload and analysis process. Company provides this description as a good faith account of how Users’ Ticket Images are processed. This description is intended to be comprehensible to the average user and is not intended as, and should not be construed to be, a binding specification of the Services.</p>
      <p>When a User submits information about a speeding ticket, the User may optionally upload an image of the ticket (i.e., a Ticket Image). Under normal operation, image handling is functions as follows:</p>
      <p>Sanitization and Standardization. Uploaded images are sanitized server-side and re-encoded or resized to remove embedded metadata and prepare the image for Automated Processing.</p>
      <p>Temporary Quarantine Storage. Sanitized images are placed in private, non-public storage for short-term processing. Only a reference to the image is stored in application databases.</p>
      <p>Automated OCR Processing. Background processing systems retrieve the image and submit it to automated OCR services to extract text and identify relevant ticket values (i.e., speed, speed limit, location).</p>
      <p>Deletion After Processing. Following completion of Automated Processing, the system is designed to delete the image as part of cleanup procedures.</p>
      <p>Deletion Backstop. Temporary image storage is subject to automated lifecycle controls intended to delete images within a limited time window (not to exceed twenty-four (24) hours), even if processing is not completed as expected.</p>
      <p><b>3.2 Image Retention and Visibility</b></p>
      <p>The Services are not intended to operate as an image-hosting or image-archiving service.</p>
      <p>Ticket Images are submitted solely to enable Automated Processing and are not retained.</p>
      <p>Under normal operation, Ticket Images are deleted shortly after processing or automatically deleted within the limited time window described above. The Platform does not present Ticket Images for routine viewing or browsing by Company personnel, however, Company retains the right to access images to comply with lawful obligations and where necessary to enforce the Terms of this Agreement such as the prohibition on malicious content.</p>
      <p>Ticket Data, as validated by Automated Processing of Ticket Images, may be displayed publicly including without limitation in feeds, maps, rankings and reports. If you do not want this information public, do not upload a Ticket Image or make a submission.</p>
      <p><b>3.3 Retained Data</b></p>
      <p>Following deletion of an Ticket Image, Company may retain structured information derived from User Content, such as jurisdictional data, speeds, dates, verification status, and internal processing indicators. Retained data does not include the underlying image or Personally Identifiable Information such as name, date of birth, driver’s license number, age, sex, etc.</p>
      <p><b>3.4 User Responsibility; No Legal Advice</b></p>
