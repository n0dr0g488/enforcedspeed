HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web v370 (based on v369; one-change)

Change made (scoped)
- Ticket card static maps on Home feed now load via the server proxy endpoint:
  - template switches from direct Google URL generation (county_static_map_url) to:
    /api/county_staticmap?geoid=...&pin_lat=...&pin_lng=...&center_on_pin=0&w=640&h=640
  - This keeps the Google Static Maps API key out of browsers (fixes Edge/Chrome referrer differences)
  - Adds server-side caching for /api/county_staticmap:
    - Redis cache when REDIS_URL is set
    - Fallback file cache under /tmp/es_staticmap_cache
    - Response headers: Cache-Control public, X-ES-Cache HIT/MISS

Guardrails respected (no-touch)
- Did NOT change ticket static map centering logic (still county-centered unless explicitly pin-centered).
- Did NOT change custom pin sizing or pin assets.
- Did NOT modify right-rail layout/minimap.
- Did NOT change Trending/Follow tables label/name resolution.

Files changed
- templates/home_feed.html
- app.py
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v361-370.txt

Production (Google) steps
- Create/rotate to a SERVER-only Static Maps key (recommended) and store it in Render as:
  - GOOGLE_MAPS_SERVER_KEY (preferred) or GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
- Key restrictions guidance after proxy:
  - Application restrictions can be None (key not shipped to browsers)
  - BUT set API restriction: Static Maps API only
  - Set strict Quotas (daily + per-minute) to hard-cap spend

Smoke tests
- python -m py_compile app.py
- es-up
- Verify in browser:
  - Home feed loads fast
  - Ticket card static images appear (multiple cards)
  - Right-rail minimap loads (custom pins still show)
  - Trending/Follow tables show real names, not GEOIDs
  - Optional: open DevTools Network and confirm ticket static map IMG src begins with /api/county_staticmap (no maps.googleapis.com in the browser)

Git (going live = push)
