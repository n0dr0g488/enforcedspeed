HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v420)

Change in this ZIP (ONE THEME)
- Home feed infinite scroll (Facebook-style): load 5 initially, then auto-load 5 more as you scroll.

Why
- Smaller initial HTML + fewer static-map image requests up-front.
- Better UX vs paging.

Implementation notes
- Server: home route supports fragment fetch via ?fragment=1 and returns JSON {html,next_page,has_next}.
- Template: feed cards moved into a #feed-items container; a sentinel triggers IntersectionObserver.
- Preserve-scroll (like/comment/delete) is re-bound for dynamically appended content.
- Pagination links remain as no-JS fallback (hidden when JS is active).

Smoke tests
- python -m py_compile app.py
- Home loads with 5 tickets.
- Scrolling loads more tickets automatically (no full page refresh).
- Like/comment/delete on ANY loaded card does not jump to top.
- Ticket card static maps still render.

Render
- Health check path: /healthz
- Start Command: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT} --access-logfile - --error-logfile -
- Do NOT set PORT env var.
