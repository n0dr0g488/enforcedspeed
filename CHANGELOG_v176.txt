ENFORCEDSPEED v176 — Multi-select “Done” button fix (Map + Rankings)

Problem
- On /strictness (and /map), the multi-select dropdowns for “Posted speed limit” / “Overage” opened, but the “Done” button did not apply/close like it does on the Home feed.

Root cause
- The multi-select behavior JavaScript existed only on the Home feed page (bound to #feedFilters), so Map and Rankings had no handler for the “Done” button or auto-submit-on-close.

Fix
- templates/strictness.html: Added the same multi-select JS (bound to #strictnessFilters).
- templates/map_page.html: Added the same multi-select JS (bound to #mapFilters).

Notes
- No visual changes intended.
- ZIP packaged with a single unique top-level root folder matching the version name.
