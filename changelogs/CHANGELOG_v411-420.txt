CHANGELOG v411–v420

v411 (created, not deployed)
- Render hardening idea: avoid doing any DB schema/bootstrap work at web process startup; gate behind ES_BOOTSTRAP_DB_ON_START=1.
  (Ultimately PORT env var was the real cause of the “spinning deploy” symptom.)

v412
- Interactive Map pin color scheme updated to match the site-wide intent:
  - Selected pin: deep red
  - In-focus context pins: mid-gray
  - Out-of-focus context pins: same gray, ghosted
- Added local ghosted pin asset (pin_outside_ghostgray.png) used by the interactive map.

v413
- Interactive Map: out-of-focus (ghost) pins now appear correctly by loading context pins beyond the focus polygon.
  - Added context_mode=1 support to /api/map_pins and show “in focus” count in the map meta line.
  - Added viewport bounds filtering to /api/map_pins so the context stays local to what you’re viewing.
- Home feed ticket-card static maps: now include context pins using the same color scheme:
  - Selected pin: deep red
  - In-county context pins: mid-gray
  - Out-of-county context pins: ghost gray
