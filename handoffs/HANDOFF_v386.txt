HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v386, one-change-at-a-time, NO REGRESSIONS)

Change in this version (minimap only)
- Force minimap visual change to take effect by cache-busting:
  - home_feed.html calls api_home_minimap_staticmap with ?v=386
  - api_home_minimap_staticmap forwards cb=386 to Google Static Maps
  - response Cache-Control set to no-store
- Keeps v385 minimap zoom+1 bounds and UI crop wrapper.

Guardrails unchanged: ticket card static maps, centering logic, pin sizing, right-rail layout, table naming.
