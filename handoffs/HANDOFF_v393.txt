HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web (v393)

Change summary
- Interactive Map page polish:
  - Map card now has bottom breathing room so border is visible (not flush with viewport edge)
  - Left filter rail no longer has an inner scrollbar (matches Home filter rail)
  - Mouse wheel zoom works without holding CTRL (Google Maps gestureHandling=greedy)
  - Right panel stats header now reflects the selected county/state, or shows 'Select a county or state' when none
  - Removed the extra helper sentence under stats when no county is selected
