v305 — 2026-02-14
- Submit: rename "Pin" label to "Map pin" on Submit a Ticket.
- Filters (Home/Map/Statistics): remove section headers (Location/Evidence/Visibility) to reduce visual clutter.
- Filters (Home/Map/Statistics): remove Hide anonymous toggle (anonymous submissions no longer supported).

- Filters (Home/Map/Statistics): convert Date and Sort by headings into standard field labels for consistent typography.
- Styles: add .filter-check (green ✓) for Photo ✓ label.


v306 — 2026-02-14
- Filters (Home/Map/Statistics): move Photo ✓ toggle directly under County (above Posted speed limit).
- Filters (Home/Map/Statistics): add Map pin toggle to filter tickets with a user-placed map pin.
- Filters: move Deleted (admin) control to the bottom of the filter panel (and add it to Map).
- Styles: make multi-select summary text (e.g., “Any”) non-bold for consistent typography.


v307 — 2026-02-14
- Filters (Home/Map/Statistics): add green ✓ to the Map pin label (match Photo ✓ styling).
- Styles: align filter control font sizing so multi-select summaries (Posted speed limit/Overage) match Date/Sort by dropdowns.

v308 (2026-02-14) — Filter rail: unify control font-size (Posted/Overage multi-select summaries now match Date/Sort dropdowns).
v309 (2026-02-14) — Filter rail: force Posted/Overage multi-select summary typography to match Date/Sort selects (font-size/weight/line-height), keeping 'Any' non-bold.

v310 (2026-02-14) — Filter rail: correct remaining font mismatch by standardizing filter control typography to 15px across selects + multi-select summaries (matches perceived select size).


v311 (2026-02-14) — Filter rail: replace Posted speed limit and Overage controls with compact native dropdowns (≤35 / 40–55 / ≥60; 1–10 / 11–20 / ≥21) to match State/Date/Sort typography and eliminate control-type font mismatch.

v312 (2026-02-14) — Fix v311 syntax error + overage Any handling
- Fix SyntaxError in app.py (unmatched bracket) introduced in v311.
- Ensure overage dropdown 'Any' (value 'all') does not apply a filter (strip 'all' from filter_over_list) across routes.
v316 — 2026-02-15
- Legal: replace Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages with final provided text.
- Legal: add Cookie Policy page and add footer link next to Privacy/Terms (same styling).
- Notes: v313–v315 regressed county autocomplete; do not use those builds. v312 remains last known-good baseline.



v317 — 2026-02-15
- Home: shorten welcome blurb under “Welcome to EnforcedSpeed.” and remove separate “Important:” disclaimer line (new combined disclaimer text).
