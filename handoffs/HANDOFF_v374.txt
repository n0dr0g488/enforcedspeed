HANDOFF — EnforcedSpeed Web v374 (based on v373; one-change)

Problem
- Home feed ticket-card static maps + right-rail minimap showed Google default pins and g.co/staticmaperror.
- Root cause: query-string encoding was turning marker directives into invalid syntax (e.g., "icon:" becoming "icon%3A"), so Google never fetched the custom icon.

Change made (scoped)
- Static Maps URL building now preserves Google directive syntax (icon:, enc:) while still URL-encoding the icon URL itself.
- Applied to:
  - county_static_map_url() (ticket cards)
  - /api/home_minimap_staticmap (right-rail minimap)
  - mobile/static preview proxy endpoint block (same encoding pattern)

Guardrails respected
- Did NOT change ticket card centering rules.
- Did NOT change custom pin sizes.
- Did NOT change right-rail layout or table label resolution.

Files changed
- app.py
- VERSION.txt
- changelogs/CHANGELOG_v371-380.txt
- handoffs/HANDOFF_v374.txt

Smoke tests
- python -m py_compile app.py
- es-up
- Verify:
  - Home feed ticket card images render (no g.co/staticmaperror)
  - Google logs show GET /static/img/pins/pin_inside_deepred_static.png from "Google-Static-Maps-API"
  - Right-rail minimap uses custom pins
